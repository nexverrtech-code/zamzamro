# Zam Zam Pure Water System — Website

**Pure Forever.** RO water purifier sales, service & installation in Erode, Tamil Nadu.

React 19 · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS v4 · Three.js / React Three Fiber / drei · Motion · Lenis · React Router 7 · Sharp · Cloudflare Workers (static assets).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # local dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run images    # assets/raw → optimised WebP + icons + OG image in public/images
npm run build     # tsc type-check → vite build → post-build SEO (per-route HTML, sitemap, robots)
npm run deploy    # build + wrangler deploy (Cloudflare Workers static assets)
```

First deploy: run `npx wrangler login` once. If npm warns about install scripts for `esbuild`/`workerd`, approve them (`npm install-scripts approve esbuild workerd`) so Wrangler can run.

## Languages (English / தமிழ்)

- The EN | தமிழ் switch sits in the header (and in the mobile menu). The choice is remembered in the browser.
- UI text lives in `src/i18n/dict.ts` (same keys for `en` and `ta`). Product, service, FAQ and journey Tamil text sits next to the English in `src/data/*` under `ta`.
- Tamil wording for the brand follows the official Tamil business card: **ஜம் ஜம் · தூய குடிநீர் அமைப்பு · என்றும் தூய்மை · ஈரோடு**. The logo wordmark, preloader and business card (About & Contact) switch with the language.
- URLs, page titles and structured data stay in English for search engines. WhatsApp enquiry messages are always sent in English so the shop receives a consistent format.

## How the 3D hero works

- `Hero.tsx` maps scroll progress through a tall section (sticky viewport) to `heroStore.progress`.
- `heroStore.timeline(p)` derives every stage from that one value: turn → translucent shell → four cartridges light up →
  tap pressed → stream → glass fills (bubbles, splash) → underwater → turquoise background → camera toward the glass → tap released, green indicator.
- The canvas uses `frameloop="demand"`: frames render only while something moves, and stop when off-screen or the tab is hidden.
- The 3D chunk is lazy-loaded after the preloader. No WebGL or a WebGL error → static Shapure photo hero with the same captions and product link.
- The model is the **Aqua Era Shapure (Core Series)**, built procedurally from the front product photo
  (proportions, ribbed smoked tank, brushed AQUA ERA band, chrome tap frame, SHAPURE badge, Power/Full/Purify strip).
  It is illustrative, not a manufacturer CAD file. To use a real model, add a `.glb` and swap `PurifierModel` for a `useGLTF` loader.

## Honesty rules baked into the data

- No prices, ratings, reviews, capacities, warranties, certifications or founding dates are invented. Empty specs render “Enquire for details”.
- Product claims are limited to what the brand creatives state (source noted on each product page).
- Hours, email and named service areas stay hidden until filled in `src/data/business.ts`.
- “Jobs We Were Trusted With” shows a clearly-marked placeholder until real, approved jobs are added to `src/data/works.ts`.
